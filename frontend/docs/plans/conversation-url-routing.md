# Feature Plan: Conversation URL Routing

# Overview

Currently, the chat application manages all conversations through in-memory state without URL integration. This means users cannot bookmark conversations, share direct links to specific chats, or use browser navigation (back/forward) to move between conversations. We're implementing URL-based routing to make conversation IDs part of the URL structure (`/chat/{conversation_id}`), enabling proper web navigation patterns and improving user experience.

The key challenge is handling the lifecycle of new conversations gracefully, since conversation IDs aren't created until the first message is sent. We need a clean solution that handles both new and existing conversations seamlessly.

# Outcomes

- Users can bookmark specific conversations with URLs like `/chat/abc123`
- Browser back/forward buttons work to navigate between conversations
- Direct links to conversations can be shared with other authenticated users
- Page refreshes maintain the active conversation context
- New conversation creation has a clean URL state before the first message
- URL and application state remain synchronized at all times
- SEO-friendly URLs that could be indexed if conversations become public/shared

# Open Questions

[x] Should we use `/chat/new` or `/chat/new?workflowId=xyz` for new conversations, or just `/chat` with no ID?
> Use `/chat/new?workflowId=xyz` pattern for new conversations

[x] How should we handle invalid/deleted conversation IDs in URLs? Redirect to `/chat` or show an error?
> Show a 404 error page

[x] Should we preemptively generate conversation IDs on the frontend before the first message, or wait for server creation?
> Wait for server creation, then replace the client URL

[x] Do we want to support additional URL parameters like `/chat/{id}?messageId=xyz` for deep linking to specific messages?
> Not in this iteration

[x] Should conversation URLs be shareable between different users (with proper permissions), or only work for the conversation owner?
> Skip for now - no permissions system in place yet. Future enhancement.

[x] How should we handle the transition when a new conversation gets its ID after the first message? Soft navigation or hard redirect?
> Use URL rewrite (replaceState) to maintain smooth UX

[x] Should we implement URL slugs for readability (e.g., `/chat/project-discussion-abc123`) or stick with UUIDs?
> Stick with UUIDs for simplicity

# Tasks

[x] Ensure sidebar reflects URL-based active conversation

## New Conversation Flow

[x] Handle workflow selection via query parameter (`?workflowId=xyz`)
[x] Implement smooth transition from `/chat/new` to `/chat/{id}` after first message
[x] Add loading/transition UI during conversation creation
[x] Handle edge case of navigating away from unsent new conversation

## URL State Synchronization

[x] Add browser history management for conversation navigation
[x] Handle popstate events for browser back/forward
[x] Ensure URL updates don't trigger unnecessary re-renders
[x] Add debouncing for rapid conversation switching

[x] Add user-friendly error messages for common scenarios
[x] Handle race conditions during conversation loading
[ ] Implement retry logic for transient failures

## Testing

[x] Unit tests for URL parsing and validation logic
[ ] Integration tests for conversation navigation flow
[ ] E2E tests for complete user journeys (new chat, switch, refresh, etc.)
[ ] Test browser navigation (back/forward) behavior
[ ] Test error scenarios (invalid IDs, network failures, etc.)
[ ] Performance tests for rapid conversation switching

# Security

## URL Parameter Validation

- Validate conversation IDs match UUID format before API calls
- Sanitize any query parameters to prevent injection attacks
- Implement rate limiting for conversation loading requests

## Access Control

- Verify user owns/has access to conversation before loading
- Return 404 (not 403) for unauthorized access to prevent ID enumeration
- Implement conversation access tokens if URLs become shareable

## Session Management

- Ensure URL-based navigation respects authentication state
- Handle expired sessions gracefully without exposing conversation IDs
- Clear URL state on logout to prevent information leakage

# Technical Design

## URL Structure

```
/chat                     → Default view (most recent or new conversation)
/chat/new                 → Explicitly new conversation
/chat/new?workflowId=xyz  → New conversation with pre-selected workflow
/chat/{conversationId}    → Specific conversation
/chat/{conversationId}?messageId=xyz → Deep link to specific message (future)
```

## State Flow

```
1. User navigates to /chat/{id}
2. ChatPage reads ID from useParams()
3. ChatPage calls context.initializeFromUrl(id)
4. Context validates and loads conversation
5. Context updates activeConversationId
6. ChatContainer renders based on context state
7. URL and state remain synchronized
```

## New Conversation Lifecycle

```
1. User clicks "New Chat" → Navigate to /chat/new
2. User selects workflow (optional) → Updates to /chat/new?workflowId=xyz
3. User sends first message → Create conversation on server
4. Server returns conversation ID → Use replaceState to update URL to /chat/{id}
5. Subsequent messages use existing conversation
```

## Edge Cases to Handle

- Multiple rapid conversation switches
- Network failure during conversation creation
- Deleted conversation in URL
- Invalid UUID format in URL
- User permissions changed after URL generation
- Browser refresh during new conversation creation
- Concurrent updates from multiple tabs

# Performance Considerations

## Optimizations

- Preload conversation metadata for faster switching
- Cache recently viewed conversations in memory
- Use React Router's data loading patterns for prefetching
- Implement virtual scrolling for long conversation lists
- Lazy load message history as needed

## Monitoring

- Track conversation load times
- Monitor URL navigation performance
- Log failed conversation loads with reasons
- Track user navigation patterns for UX improvements

# Migration Strategy

## Rollout Plan

1. Implement URL routing alongside existing state management
2. Deploy with feature flag for gradual rollout
3. Monitor for issues and performance impacts
4. Migrate all users once stable
5. Remove legacy state-only navigation code

## Backwards Compatibility

- Support both URL and state-based navigation initially
- Redirect old bookmarks to new URL structure
- Maintain API compatibility for existing clients
- Provide clear migration path for any external integrations

# Implementation Notes Based on Decisions

Based on the resolved questions, here are the key implementation details:

1. **New Conversation URL**: Use `/chat/new` with optional `?workflowId=xyz` query parameter
2. **Invalid IDs**: Show a proper 404 error component (not redirect)
3. **ID Generation**: Server-side only, use `replaceState` for smooth URL update
4. **URL Format**: Simple UUIDs, no slugs or additional parameters for now
5. **Permissions**: Single-user only for this iteration
6. **Navigation**: Use browser's `replaceState` for new conversation ID assignment to avoid history pollution

# Implementation Complete - 2025-08-17

## Summary of Changes

### Core Implementation
- **Routes Added**: `/chat`, `/chat/new`, `/chat/:conversationId` in App.tsx
- **404 Component**: Created `ConversationNotFound.tsx` for invalid conversation IDs
- **URL Synchronization**: Updated ChatPage with React Router hooks (`useParams`, `useNavigate`, `useLocation`, `useSearchParams`)
- **Context Updates**: Modified `setActiveConversation()` to accept optional `updateUrl` parameter
- **New Chat Flow**: Implemented `/chat/new` handling with workflow query parameter support
- **Navigation**: All sidebar clicks now use URL navigation instead of direct state changes

### Key Features Implemented
1. **URL-based Navigation**: Browser back/forward buttons work correctly
2. **Bookmarkable URLs**: Each conversation has a unique URL that can be saved
3. **New Conversation Flow**: `/chat/new` → create conversation → `replaceState` to `/chat/{id}`
4. **404 Handling**: Invalid UUIDs show error page with navigation options
5. **Workflow Pre-selection**: `?workflowId=xyz` query parameter sets workflow for new chats
6. **Smooth Transitions**: Uses `replaceState` to avoid polluting browser history
