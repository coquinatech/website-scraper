# Frontend workflow.updated Event Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented support for `workflow.updated` SSE events in the frontend ChatSSEService. The frontend can now receive and process real-time workflow state updates from the backend.

## Changes Made

### 1. ChatSSEService Updates (`src/features/chat/services/ChatSSEService.ts`)
- **Added `handleWorkflowUpdated()` method**: Processes `workflow.updated` events containing full workflow state
- **Added event case in switch statement**: Routes `workflow.updated` events to the handler
- **Imports updated**: Added `ConversationItem` and `ToolCallRound` types

#### Key Features of the Handler:
- Extracts workflow state, sequence, and timestamp from events
- Updates conversation state with full workflow data
- Emits appropriate events based on workflow status:
  - `conversation.updated` - When conversation state changes
  - `workflow.progress` - When workflow is still active
  - `workflow.completed` - When workflow finishes successfully
  - `workflow.error` - When workflow encounters an error
- Includes metadata (sequence, timestamp, status, model) in emitted events

### 2. Type Updates (`src/features/chat/types/chat.types.ts`)
- **Extended `ChatServiceEvent` type** to support:
  - `conversation.updated` with optional metadata
  - `workflow.completed` with optional metadata
  - New `workflow.error` event type
- Metadata includes sequence number, timestamp, status, and model information

### 3. Testing Infrastructure

#### MockSSEStream (`src/features/chat/services/__tests__/MockSSEStream.ts`)
Created a comprehensive mock SSE stream service that:
- Simulates backend SSE event streaming
- Provides pre-built scenarios:
  - Simple conversation flow
  - Tool call interactions
  - Error scenarios
- Supports custom event sequences with configurable delays
- Mimics the exact format of backend events

#### Integration Tests (`src/features/chat/services/__tests__/ChatSSEService.workflow.test.ts`)
Comprehensive test suite covering:
- ✅ Basic workflow.updated event handling
- ✅ Conversation state updates
- ✅ Metadata inclusion in events
- ✅ Workflow progress tracking
- ✅ Tool call integration
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Malformed event resilience
- ✅ Sequence number tracking

## How It Works

### Event Flow
1. Backend sends `workflow.updated` event via SSE
2. ChatSSEService receives and parses the event
3. Handler extracts workflow state and metadata
4. Conversation state is updated via `transformConversation()`
5. Appropriate events are emitted to UI components
6. UI components update based on new conversation state

### Event Structure
```javascript
{
  event: 'workflow.updated',
  data: {
    workflow: {
      conversation: { /* full conversation data */ },
      conversationId: string,
      status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'error',
      model: string,
      error?: string
    },
    sequence: number,
    timestamp: string
  }
}
```

## Testing Approach

Instead of unit testing individual methods, we:
1. Created a mock SSE stream that simulates the backend
2. Test the service's behavior with realistic event sequences
3. Verify the correct events are emitted
4. Ensure conversation state is properly updated

This approach better tests the real-world behavior of SSE event handling.

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Updates**: UI receives updates as the workflow progresses
2. **Full State Consistency**: Each update contains complete state, no complex diffing needed
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing event handlers continue to work
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles malformed events
5. **Sequence Tracking**: Metadata allows tracking event order

## Next Steps

### Remaining Tasks:
1. **Verify UI Updates** - Test with actual UI components
2. **Add Visual Feedback** - Implement progress indicators for workflow stages

### Integration Points:
- ChatContainer component should listen for `conversation.updated` events
- Tool call UI should continue using existing `tool.call.*` events
- Error handling UI should listen for `workflow.error` events

## Testing Results

All tests passing:
- 7 workflow.updated specific tests ✅
- 21 total ChatSSEService tests ✅
- TypeScript compilation successful ✅

The frontend is now ready to receive and process real-time workflow updates from the backend SSE stream!
